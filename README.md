# SampleSuperstore_EDA
To Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ using Power BI
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

For this, we have created 2 dashboards: 
  (i) Showing the statistics globally present in the data set
  (ii)Showing the Region-Wise drill down along with State-wise and Country-wise statistics.
  
A power point presentation is added listing the weak areas and the solutions that can be applied for the same.
